**Subject:** Application for Software Engineering Internship

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineering Internship opportunity at **Howmuch** / **Foodnerd** in Lahore. As a passionate and dedicated **Software Engineering student**, currently in my 4th semester, I have been actively building my skills through academic projects, hands-on development work, and continuous learning in areas like **Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning**, and **Full-Stack Development**.

Despite still being a student, I’ve already covered much of the curriculum scheduled for upcoming semesters through self-study, online certifications, and hands-on project work. My core technical stack includes **C++, Python, Git**, and foundational knowledge in **OOP, file handling**, and basic **machine learning** workflows. I thrive in problem-solving environments and have a deep interest in applying theory to practical, scalable solutions.

Although I have a strong personal interest in Machine Learning, my academic foundation and practical experience are firmly rooted in core Software Engineering principles. This internship is a perfect opportunity for me to deepen my expertise in software development and strengthen my capabilities in building reliable, scalable systems.

The chance to work with an innovative and fast-moving company like yours truly excites me. I’m eager to apply my skills, collaborate with experienced professionals, and contribute to impactful projects that make a real difference.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love to discuss how I can contribute to your team and continue growing as a software engineer.

Warm regards,  
**Muhammad Rameez**
